                <p class="about-description">Our purpose for making this was to create a way to get sheet music for something that you heard. There have been so many times in our lives that we heard music we wanted to learn but because we don't have perfect pitch nor perfect memory, were not able to remember and recreate that music. This app helps to solve it as you can record and get sheet music right in your browser to learn.</p>
