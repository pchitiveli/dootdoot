                <p class="about-description" style="text-align: center;">DootDoot uses a variety of technologies to be able to achieve the capabilities it has. 
                    The website uploadds the .wav file to a <b>Flask server.</b> This then <i>preprocesses</i> the audio file by <i>reducing background noise</i> 
                    and <i>cropping out unnecessary silences</i>, as well as implementing <i>convolutional waveform smoothing</i> to make changes in the audio more evident. 
                    The program then extracts various <b>features</b> such as the <i>BPM</i>. Using the BPM, troughs, and peaks found in the .wav file, 
                    the file is split into <i>individual notes</i>. These notes are converted into <b>chromagrams</b> and the pitch is analyzed to get a the note value. 
                    This value is then further validated by a <b>custom deep Convolutional Neural Network model</b> that was built <i>from scratch</i>. The note's waveform is 
                    converted into a <b>spectrogram</b> and fed into the deep CNN model to get the note value. Once we have all the notes, we sequence them into a sheet music pdf 
                    and send it back to the website for the user to download.</p>
